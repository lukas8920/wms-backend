# wms-backend

**wms-backend** is a backend service designed to support integration with Odoo's Warehouse Management System (WMS), with a current focus on importing sales orders. The system is implemented in Java and follows a modular, service-oriented architecture for extensibility and maintainability.

## Features

- **Sales Order Import:**
    - Accepts new sales orders via a REST API endpoint (`/v1/api/saleorder`).
    - Each sales order includes a partner reference, an external client order reference, and one or more sales lines (products/quantities).
    - Validates partner and product existence before creating orders.
    - Ensures sale order references are unique; prevents duplicates.
    - Handles the creation of sale orders and associated sale lines in Odoo via API calls.
    - Updates the status of newly created sale orders.
    - Rolls back all changes if any part of the creation process fails, ensuring data consistency.
- **Error Handling and Logging:**
    - Provides detailed error responses for invalid requests or system errors.
    - All operations are logged for traceability.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **API Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Integration:** Odoo (via custom API classes)
- **Testing:** JUnit with Mockito for service layer tests

## API Overview

- **POST /v1/api/saleorder**
    - Submits a new sales order for import.
    - Requires JSON payload with partner, clientOrderRef, and lines.
